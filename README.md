# Daily Fantasy Sports Roster Optimizer

Welcome to the Daily Fantasy Sports Roster Optimizer project! 
My main goal is to help you win money by leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms to create optimized rosters for competitive Daily Fantasy Sports contests. 

## What We Do

My ML algorithm carefully analyzes the pool of available players and strategically assembles thousands of high-performing rosters while adhering to the salary cap.

You can also influence the algorithm's choices by picking players you know in your gut are going to go off!

The "Classic" format, which is commonly used in NFL DFS contests, includes the following positions:

- 1 Quarterback (QB)
- 3 Wide Receivers (WR)
- 2 Running Backs (RB)
- 1 Tight End (TE)
- 1 Flex (can be either a RB, WR, or TE)
- 1 Defense/Special Teams (D/ST)

Our algorithm ensures that your roster composition adheres to these position requirements and maximizes your chances of success.
